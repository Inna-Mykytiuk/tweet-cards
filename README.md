Advanced Filtering

Our application goes beyond the basics. We've integrated a filtering feature that enables you to sort tweet cards based on whether you follow the users associated with them or not. This makes it a breeze to focus on the tweets that truly matter to you, enhancing your Twitter experience.

Seamless Card Loading

TweetDeck Connect is designed for your convenience. With our seamless card loading feature, you can keep scrolling through tweet cards without interruption.
